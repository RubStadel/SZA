# SZA

 Website suggestion for the infamous Schlafzimmeranalysator (TM) by @Zimpto.

---

## SZA_1

- has a relaxed look about it, featuring tiles for each measurement.
These tiles are colorcoded and have a shadow effect, seen when hovering over them.
- Also has an animated background gradient that is partly hidden behind a static plain with circular cutouts.

---

## SZA_2

- has a minimal look featuring four colorcoded tabs
- has link to ministry of health
- shows a recommended range for measurements
- doesn't allow user to reload the page (via reload button) for the first two seconds

*ToDo:*

- ~~pill that moves to current tab~~
- ~~change animation of the tabs (smoother, more directional)~~
- ~~recommended range (circular visualization)~~
- ~~link info buttons~~
- add labels to the range
