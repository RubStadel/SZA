 Website suggestion for the infamous Schlafzimmeranalysator (TM) by Zimpto.

Currently has a relaxed look about it featuring tiles for each Measurement.
    These tiles are colorcoded and have a shadow effect, seen when hovering over them.
Also has an animated background gradient that is partly hidden behind a static plain with circular cutouts.
