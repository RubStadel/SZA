# SZA

 Website suggestion for the infamous Schlafzimmeranalysator (TM) by [@Zimpto](https://github.com/Zimpto "Thomas Zimmermann").

## SZA_1

- has a relaxed look about it, featuring tiles for each measurement.
These tiles are colorcoded and have a shadow effect, seen when hovering over them.
- Also has an animated background gradient that is partly hidden behind a static plain with circular cutouts.
